# Disaster-response-mapping
An AI powered solution that analyses geospatial aerial imagery to map affected areas, people, vehicles, detect terrain changes and generate 3D models assisting in rescue planning and prioritisation. Provides real-time insights for emergency response teams 

Disaster response mapping is critical as natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and landslides can cause widespread damage. Current approaches rely heavily on manual analysis of satellite or drone imagery, which is time-consuming, prone to human error, and difficult to scale across large disaster zones. Moreover, 2D imagery alone cannot capture the full 3D structure of damaged areas, making it hard to assess structural damage, flooded zones, or terrain changes accurately

1. Our project aims to build an AI system that automatically processes aerial and satellite imagery to:

2. Detect and segment damaged buildings, debris, flooded areas, and roads.

3. Identify humans and vehicles for prioritizing rescue efforts.

4. Estimate depth and reconstruct 3D terrain and structures using the point cloud framework.

5. Generate actionable maps for disaster response teams in near real-time.

This approach leverages computer vision, depth estimation, pose detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D point cloud analysis to provide a comprehensive, scalable, and rapid disaster response tool.
